# MinSpaningTreeAlgo

The program Finds Minimum Spanning Tree in Graph that has been created from a given file (command arguments).

The program finding the tree and his weight using Kruskal algorithm and Prim algorithm.

The program also checks the weight of a min spanning tree after removing spesific edge given in the file using Kruskal algorithm (if exist).

Data structures has been used: 

1. Union-Find
2. Min Heap 
3. Graph

Down below are some test files to check the program:
